# What
SecTalks meetups are about participating in IT security discussions, learning from others, and improving problem-solving skills. 
SecTalks offers an avenue where you can team-up with likeminded people to participate in solving a technical IT security challenge (i.e. Capture The Flag).

Through SecTalks CTF people learn and share solutions. The goal is not to just award winners but to allow people understand 
their problem and find a solution.

# How

SecTalks has three formats, Talk & long CTF, Talk &
short CTF, and a Ninja Night. Read more [here](./formats).

# Who

It is 100% organic voluntary effort, organised by teams of passionate individuals and supported by
a community of great people. It is a community for people with different skillset e.g. ops, devs, sysadmins, security researchers etc.

#'no bullshit!' clause
The ‘no bullshit’ clause means the SecTalks organising team strictly keeps
SecTalks away from bullshits (politics, vendor pitch, harassment, you know it!).
