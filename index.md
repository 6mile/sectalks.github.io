    Monthly technical (in)security talks and hands-on challenges,
    no bullshit!

# What is SecTalks?

SecTalks is a non-profit session for technical security talks, 
and hands-on challenge, no bullshit! A forum to discuss technical 
(in)security stuff and share our thoughts. 


# What does happen at a SecTalks?

We generally have a monthly catch-up where someone presents on
something interesting (sometimes VERY interesting!). We also have a monthly 
or 60min challenge that everyone gets their hands on. We award the best 
challenge solution and buy a beer for the speaker.


# What is SecTalks' Ninja Night (NN)?

This is a night where you show off your ninja skills. A typical night goes like this,
we rock-up at a pub, grab some beers, write our name down, get 'randomly' assigned 
to a team, mini CTF challenge is presented to all the teams, we start doing coolshit 
and drink more beers. The objective is to find a flag in less than 60mins and the first team 
who solves the challenge will be a winner and will present their way through the 
challenge. So you learn cool new stuff from your team members or other teams. 
For the Ninja night, you need to bring along your gears, Remember, a computer with a 
working USB port is required and there is no FREE WiFi! so if you come along with 
your raspberry-pie, make sure it has USB host module enabled and has all your 
software installed. 
And did I say? you also need to tell your mum that you will be late.


# How SecTalks is organised?

It is 100% organic voluntary effort. Something that we feel we need to have,  
People in SecTalks are quite passionate and open for new ideas and discussion. 
We have people with different background. 
e.g. security researchers, devs, netadmins, etc.
