SecTalks is being held in three formats.

# Presentation & monthly CTF

This meetup starts with 15 to 25 minutes a presentation on a technical security topic (no vendor pitch!).
Following with a question and answer. The session continues with description of monthly challenge e.g.
challenge description, rules, how to submit flags etc. 

Participant names will be added to [the team generator script]() and people will be randomly assigned
to different teams to work together in coming month and solve the CTF.

There is also a second presentation but informal for the winning team to go through their solution
of past CTF. Other teams also will talk about their solutions if differs.

# Presentation & 60min CTF

Similar to the first format, this meetup starts with 15 to 25 minutes a presentation on a technical security topic (no vendor pitch!).
Following with a question and answer. The session continues with description of 60min challenge e.g.

Participant names will be added to [the team generator script]() and people will be randomly assigned
to different teams.

Once then, 60min CTF challenge is presented to all the teams. The objective is to find a flag in less than 60min 
and the first team who solves the challenge will present their solution. 

# Ninja night

This is a night where you show off your ninja skills. A typical night goes like this, we rock-up at a pub, 
grab some beers, write our name down, get [randomly]() assigned to a team, mini CTF challenge 
is presented to all the teams, we start doing coolshit and drink more beers. The objective is to find a flag
 in less than 60min and the first team who solves the challenge will be a winner and will 
present their way through the challenge. So you learn cool new stuff from your team members or other teams
