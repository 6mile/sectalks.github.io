There is **no presentation** at a Ninja Night. 
This is a session where you show off your ninja skills. A typical evening goes like this, we rock up at a pub
(or any other venue), grab some beers, write our name down, get randomly assigned to a team,  CTF challenge 
is presented to all the teams, we start doing cool shit and drink more beers. The objective is to solve the CTF
 in **60 minutes** and the first team who solves the challenge will be a winner and will 
present their way through the challenge in the same session. 

# FAQ

## Who creates a CTF?
The SecTalks CTFs are crowd sourced. This means the previously winning team has the opportunity to create the next CTF.
This makes CTFs quite fun and keeps them evolving over time.

## How do I randomly generate teams?
Use your imagination & remember your childhood games!
There is also a **[python script](../teamgen.py)** that you can use to generate random teams
and a **[countdown](../countdown.html)** script to display the time.

## What if a team becomes so strong?
Find out who has experience playing CTF before, put them in a separate teams as a team lead.
