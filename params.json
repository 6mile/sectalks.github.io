A forum to discuss technical \r\n(in)security stuff and share our thoughts. \r\n\r\n# What does happen at a SecTalks?\r\n====================\r\nWe generally have a monthly catch-up where someone presents on\r\nsomething interesting (sometimes VERY interesting!). We also have a monthly \r\nor 60min challenge that everyone gets their hands on. We award the best \r\nchallenge solution and buy a beer for the speaker.\r\n\r\n# What is SecTalks' Ninja Night (NN)?\r\n====================\r\nThis is a night where you show off your ninja skills. A typical night goes like this,\r\nwe rock-up at a pub, grab some beers, write our name down, get 'randomly' assigned \r\nto a team, mini CTF challenge is presented to all the teams, we start doing coolshit \r\nand drink more beers. The objective is to find a flag in less than 60mins and the first team \r\nwho solves the challenge will be a winner and will present their way through the \r\nchallenge. So you learn cool new stuff from your team members or other teams. \r\nFor the Ninja night, you need to bring along your gears, Remember, a computer with a \r\nworking USB port is required and there is no FREE WiFi! so if you come along with \r\nyour raspberry-pie, make sure it has USB host module enabled and has all your \r\nsoftware installed. \r\nAnd did I say? you also need to tell your mum that you will be late.\r\n\r\n# How SecTalks is organised?\r\n====================\r\nIt is 100% organic voluntary effort. Something that we feel we need to have,  \r\nPeople in SecTalks are quite passionate and open for new ideas and discussion. \r\nWe have people with different background. \r\ne.g. security researchers, devs, netadmins, etc.\r\n\r\n# When and where is the next catch-up?\r\n====================\r\nDate & Time:  f2eb1b5c9c34e05e0d6df5dc2a672cac\r\nLocation:     75ea457db560fe9c168d4a4a8c2525d2\r\nHint: Don't try to crack it, this information is for members only.\r\n\r\n# This is super cool, I wanna join SecTalks!\r\n====================\r\nSure! We always like to get more awesome people in. \r\nWe have an entry qualification challenge that you need \r\nto solve to show us your degree of awesomeness.\r\n\r\n# What is the entry challenge?\r\n====================\r\n[1] Follow sectalks on Twitter. \r\n[2] Tweet \"@sectalks, V jnaan wbva...\".\r\n[3] The challenge details will be DMed to you.\r\n[4] Have fun and email us the flag.\r\n[!] Twitter doesn't allow for DM, if you don't follow @sectalks.\r\n\r\n# But I am new to security, can I still join?\r\n====================\r\nSecTalks is always open to anyone who is keen to learn infosec. \r\nAsk a member to refer you (see our twitter followers) or email us and \r\nlets us know why you wanna join and we will be in touch.\r\n\r\n# I've a question, how can I get in touch with you?\r\n====================\r\nEmail: guru@[REMOVE-THIS]sectalks.org \r\nTwitter: sectalks\r\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/SecTalks-6934607\r\nMeetup: http://www.meetup.com/SecTalks/\r\nIRC: irc.sectalks.org:6697 (SSL) channel: #sectalks\r\n\r\n# Looking for the previous topics?\r\n====================\r\nSYD0x04 When full is only 99.9% full by @0x6c73\r\nPER0x0e Exchanging Demands Revisited by omnifocal\r\nSYD0x03 Find all the bugs, win all the bounties by @infosec_au\r\nPER0x0d Xmas drinks!\r\nPER0x0c Drony2012: Delays in the Drone Revolution by Eluul\r\nSYD0x02 Manipulating Human Minds: The Psychological Side of Social Engineering by 0xkitty & 60min CTF\r\nSYD0x01 Insight into the world of darkness: script kiddies or an organised attack? by pi3ch + 60min CTF\r\nPER0x0b 2001::/8 an address space oddity by swarley\r\nSYD0x00 Ninja night - Criss cross\r\nPER0x0a Two guys explain exactly how hard it is to submit a simple talk title and description - by ...\r\nPER0x09 SCADA – How the security times are changing... by @NHardy\r\nPER0x08 pwning meat: the impact of social engineering (open discussion) by Chris\r\nPER0x07 When 2FA isn't implemented properly, I found a really simple way around it by @1doles\r\nPER0x06 Script kiddie or an organized attack?

Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
