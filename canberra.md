## Date & Time 

The next meetup will be on July 12th, from 6pm. 

On an ongoing basis meetups will be on the second Tuesday of each month.

## Location 

The venue is King O'Malley's Irish Pub. They are located at 131 City Walk, Canberra. We have a function room booked for the event each month. 

## How to prepare?

1. *Bring a laptop along* on the night, don't forget your power adapter!
2. Install a VM hypervisor on your laptop. Virtual box is a good free choice. You can download that [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
3. You can either install a VM such as Kali which is free and avaliable [here](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) to work from, or we will have a virtual machine image for you to install on the night.
4. We will have Wi-Fi avaliable, but otherwise you can bring along an ethernet cable for a hardwired connection.
5. People will be more than happy to give you a hand on the night, but be aware there will only be internet you provide avaliable (i.e. phone tethering).

If you rock up with a laptop and a way of running virtual machines you'll be okay to go on the night.
