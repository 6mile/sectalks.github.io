## Preparation

1. *Please bring a laptop along* on the night (and your power adapter)
2. Install a hypervisor on your laptop. VirtualBox is a good free choice. You can download that [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
3. Grab a copy of Kali - avaliable [here](https://www.kali.org/downloads/).
4. Internet is available! (but please run updates for your host OS and any VMs before coming along, so you don't chew up bandwidth)
5. People will be more than happy to give you a hand on the night if you're not confident with virtualisation.

tl;dr - if you rock up with a laptop and a way of running virtual machines you'll be okay to go on the night.

## Want to Speak or Present?

Whether it is a [lightning talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk), an introduction to a tool or concept, or a hands-on workshop, SecTalks is great place to get feedback and improve on. We encourage first-time speakers and anyone who would like to share their knowledge with the community to get in touch via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SecTalksCbr) or just talking to an organiser after a meetup.
