SecTalks helps to foster establishment of technical security meetups around the world. SecTalks meetups are
not a typical event where someone presents, everyone listen and then claps! SecTalks meetups are about
participating in discussions, learn from others, and improve problem-solving skills. As you never learn a 
Programming language by only reading a book and not writing code, you will never learn security if you don't start 
applying the knowledge. SecTalks is a place your will not only learn from others but also team-up with them
to solve a challenge (i.e. CTF). 

SecTalks CTF aims to let people learn and share solutions. The goal is not to award a team who solve the challenge
earlier than others but to allow people understand where was their problem and how to get around it. This is very
different from a typical CTF event where the goal is to come-up with solution as fast as possible.


# You can start a local SecTalks meetup today!

You can start planing to organise a SecTalks meetup today. We will provide you with a quick leg-up on getting 
organised and get going. You are 5 steps away from organising a successful meetup.

#Step 1 - Say 'Hi!'

Fill up [this form](#) and lets us know more about you and the location where you want to run the meetup.

#Step 2 - Start with a ninja night

Start thinking about format of your first meetup. The easiest is to start with a ninja night. You can run
a ninja night in any public places like a pub or a bar which is not going to cost.

After you first session, you can think to have your upcoming sessions in [different formats]().

#Step 3 - Venue, date and time

Start looking around for a venue. You don't need to pay for the venue, there are many place that you can run
2-3 hours event with no charge. Believe or not, since we started SecTalks, we haven't had  any venue cost. 
Here are some options for the venue: universities, a company's meeting room that is always empty after business hours, 
hacker spaces, co-working place, a function room in a bar or a pub, .... Make sure venue is easy for people to get in.

If your first session is a ninja night, you don't really need to book any venue, just agree with others to show
up in a pub or a bar, find a big table and start the CTF (btw, that how we started in Sydney!).

Choose a day in a month where you know there are not many other concurrent events. Historically, there are not many
events running on Tuesdays. You can also run the events on weekends but avoid Friday nights.

If you are planing to run your event in the evening, 6pm is a good start. SecTalks normally take 2 hours to finish.

#Step 4 - Reach out

Start by [creating a page](#) in this website for your local meetup. Then make a link to your twitter account, mailing list,
 linkedin group or any other social platform. We also recommend to start a group in [meetup.com](http://meetup.com), 
this gives you good publicity in your local area.

Start reaching out to people. Start with your friends, colleagues, find people at other similar events.
Don't just email them, go and talk to people and let the know about the time and location of the meetup. Make sure to
get their contact detail so you can add them to the mailing list (with their consent of course) for follow ups.

It is very important to have a close contact with people in your first few sessions so people start to schedule them in.

Search online, find related mailing list, linkedin groups, discussion boards, reddit, IRC and let people know about your local event.

We will also announce your upcoming meetup and get your message out.

There are some additional tips that we will share with you once you get started.
