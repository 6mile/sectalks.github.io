SecTalks crew helps to foster establishment of technical security meetups around the world. <span class="bg-dark-gray white">
SecTalks meetups are about participating in IT security discussions, learning from others, and improving problem-solving skills.
SecTalks offers an avenue where you can team-up with likeminded people to participate in solving
a technical IT security challenge (i.e. Capture The Flag).</span>

Through SecTalks CTF people learn and share solutions. The goal is not just award winners but to allow people 
understand their problem and find a solution. This is make our CTF different from 
from a *typical CTF* event where the goal is to harvest flags as fast as possible.

<span class="bg-dark-gray white"> The 'no bullshit' clause means we strictly keep SecTalks away from bullshits!</span> 
(politics, vendor pitch, harassment, your know it!)

<span class="bg-dark-gray white">Start planing a local SecTalks meetup today. We will provide you with a quick leg-up on getting 
organised and get going. You are 4 steps away from organising a local SecTalks meetup!</span>

#Step 1 - Say 'Hi!'

Fill up [this form](http://j.mp/sectalksorgreg) and lets us know more about you and the location where you want to run the meetup.

#Step 2 - Start with a ninja night

Start thinking about format of your first meetup. The easiest is to start with a ninja night. You can run
a ninja night in any public places like a pub or a bar which is not going to cost.

After the first session, you can think to have your upcoming sessions in a [different format](../formats/).

We will help you to find or create a CTF for your first session.

#Step 3 - Venue, date and time

Start looking around for a venue. You don't need to pay for the venue, there are many place that you can run
2-3 hours event with no charge. Believe or not, since we started SecTalks, we haven't had  any venue cost. 
Here are some options for the venue: universities, a company's meeting room that is always empty after business hours, 
hacker spaces, co-working place, a function room in a bar or a pub, .... Make sure venue is easy for people to get in.

If your first session is a ninja night, you don't really need to book any venue, just agree with others to show
up in a pub or a bar, find a big table and start the CTF (btw, that how we started in Sydney!).

Choose a day in a month where you know there are not many other concurrent events. Historically, there are not many
events running on Tuesdays. You can also choose weekends but avoid Friday nights.

If you are planing to run your event in the evening, 6pm is a good start. SecTalks normally take 2 hours to finish.

#Step 4 - Reach out

Start by [creating a page](../yourpage) in this website for your local meetup. Then make a link to your twitter account, mailing list,
 linkedin group or any other social platform. We also recommend to start a group in [meetup.com](http://meetup.com), 
this gives you good publicity in your local area.

Start reaching out to people. Start with your friends, colleagues, find people at other similar events.
Don't just email them, go and talk to people and let them know about the time and location of the meetup. Make sure to
get their contact details so you can add them to the mailing list (with their consent of course) for follow ups.

It is very important to have a close contact with people in your first few sessions so people start to schedule SecTalks in their schedule.

Advertise online, find related mailing list, linkedin groups, discussion boards, reddit, IRC and let people know about your local event.

We will also announce your upcoming meetup and get your message out.

#Tips!

We will help you in anyway we can to make sure you run a smooth event. There are many other tips that we will share with
you once you get started. Remember, it is not necessary to find speaker for each meetup. You can always default to a ninja night.

Additionally, SecTalks CTF are crowd sourced. This means the winning team has the opportunity to create the next CTF. This makes CTF quite fun, 
evolve over time and leave you with only managing the events. We also have an archive of past CTFs that you can use in an 
emergency situation.

You will be also added to the organisers' mailing list where you can get in touch with other organisers.
