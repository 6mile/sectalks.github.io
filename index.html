<a id="what-is-sectalks" class="anchor" href="#what-is-sectalks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is SecTalks?</h1>

<h1></h1>

<p>SecTalks is a non-profit session for technical security talks, 
and hands-on challenge, no bullshit! A forum to discuss technical 
(in)security stuff and share our thoughts. </p>

<a id="what-does-happen-at-a-sectalks" class="anchor" href="#what-does-happen-at-a-sectalks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does happen at a SecTalks?</h1>

<h1></h1>

<p>We generally have a monthly catch-up where someone presents on
something interesting (sometimes VERY interesting!). We also have a monthly 
or 60min challenge that everyone gets their hands on. We award the best 
challenge solution and buy a beer for the speaker.</p>

<h1></h1>

<p>This is a night where you show off your ninja skills. A typical night goes like this,
we rock-up at a pub, grab some beers, write our name down, get 'randomly' assigned 
to a team, mini CTF challenge is presented to all the teams, we start doing coolshit 
and drink more beers. The objective is to find a flag in less than 60mins and the first team 
who solves the challenge will be a winner and will present their way through the 
challenge. So you learn cool new stuff from your team members or other teams. 
For the Ninja night, you need to bring along your gears, Remember, a computer with a 
working USB port is required and there is no FREE WiFi! so if you come along with 
your raspberry-pie, make sure it has USB host module enabled and has all your 
software installed. 
And did I say? you also need to tell your mum that you will be late.</p>

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>
<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
