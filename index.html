      Monthly technical (in)security talks and hands-on challenges,
			 no bullshit!


# What is SecTalks?
====================
SecTalks is a non-profit session for technical security talks, 
and hands-on challenge, no bullshit! A forum to discuss technical 
(in)security stuff and share our thoughts. 

# What does happen at a SecTalks?
====================
We generally have a monthly catch-up where someone presents on
something interesting (sometimes VERY interesting!). We also have a monthly 
or 60min challenge that everyone gets their hands on. We award the best 
challenge solution and buy a beer for the speaker.

# What is SecTalks' Ninja Night (NN)?
====================
This is a night where you show off your ninja skills. A typical night goes like this,
we rock-up at a pub, grab some beers, write our name down, get 'randomly' assigned 
to a team, mini CTF challenge is presented to all the teams, we start doing coolshit 
and drink more beers. The objective is to find a flag in less than 60mins and the first team 
who solves the challenge will be a winner and will present their way through the 
challenge. So you learn cool new stuff from your team members or other teams. 
For the Ninja night, you need to bring along your gears, Remember, a computer with a 
working USB port is required and there is no FREE WiFi! so if you come along with 
your raspberry-pie, make sure it has USB host module enabled and has all your 
software installed. 
And did I say? you also need to tell your mum that you will be late.

# How SecTalks is organised?
====================
It is 100% organic voluntary effort. Something that we feel we need to have,  
People in SecTalks are quite passionate and open for new ideas and discussion. 
We have people with different background. 
e.g. security researchers, devs, netadmins, etc.

# When and where is the next catch-up?
====================
Date & Time:  f2eb1b5c9c34e05e0d6df5dc2a672cac
Location:     75ea457db560fe9c168d4a4a8c2525d2
Hint: Don't try to crack it, this information is for members only.

# This is super cool, I wanna join SecTalks!
====================
Sure! We always like to get more awesome people in. 
We have an entry qualification challenge that you need 
to solve to show us your degree of awesomeness.

# What is the entry challenge?
====================
[1] Follow sectalks on Twitter. 
[2] Tweet "@sectalks, V jnaan wbva...".
[3] The challenge details will be DMed to you.
[4] Have fun and email us the flag.
[!] Twitter doesn't allow for DM, if you don't follow @sectalks.

# But I am new to security, can I still join?
====================
SecTalks is always open to anyone who is keen to learn infosec. 
Ask a member to refer you (see our twitter followers) or email us and 
lets us know why you wanna join and we will be in touch.
