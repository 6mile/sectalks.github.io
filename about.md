## About SecTalks

It all started on a Sunday afternoon, 10th November 2023, in Perth, Western
Australia. [@pi3ch](https://x.com/pi3ch), sent out an email to a group of
friends and fellow security professionals.

The email wasn't about a big event
or a formal meetup—it was a simple invitation to hang out and talk about
security.

In the email, @pi3ch didn’t have a fancy name for the gathering, so he called
it "security talks." And just like that, SecTalks was born. The idea was
straightforward: bring together people who genuinely care about infosec,
without all the commercial noise (the “no bullshit” clause). This was meant to
be a space for honest conversations, not sales pitches.

The next challenge was making it a regular thing. Perth’s security community
was small, and finding speakers wasn’t easy. That’s when @pi3ch came up with a
fun idea—why not add a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge to the mix? The idea
was simple: a quick 60-minute CTF during the event, and the winner would share
their walkthrough at the next meetup. It worked! The community loved it, and it
became a core part of SecTalks, helping the group grow and keeping the meetups
consistent.

With this authentic, no-nonsense approach, SecTalks started to resonate with
others. More organisers who shared the “security talks, no bullshit” philosophy
joined in, and soon enough, SecTalks spread to every capital city in
Australia—and even beyond.
