SecTalks is **a non-profit community** that holds regular presentations and hand-on
challenges on information security topics.  SecTalks is **an Australian
initiative** and that was established in November 2013 in **Perth**. Since then it
has grown to other cities in Australia including **Sydney, Brisbane and
Melbourne**.  At the time of writing, it has over **500 members across Australia**
and every day new members join the SecTalks community.

### Innovative format 
SecTalks has a new meetup format. **It brings together both
theoretical (through discussions and presentations) and practical (through
Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges) aspects of security in a 2-3 hour session.**
SecTalks presentations are focused on new and cutting-edge security related
topics.  A SecTalks CTF is a single and short CTF challenge. Attendees are
teamed up to solve the CTF. The winning team discusses their solution with
other teams and creates the next CTF challenge. The objective of the SecTalks
CTF challenges is to give people the opportunity to learn and improve their
skills.  SecTalks has created an open and **‘cool’ environment that attracts
beginners, experts, and many people with passion in information security.** 

### Passionate members 
SecTalks caters for both security professionals and
beginners. It has established a community that has helped to fulfil their
passion by improving their knowledge and skills in the field of information
security.  University students, information security professionals, software
engineers, system administrators, and network engineers are among many groups
of people who have participated in SecTalks meetups in the past.  Everyone who
participates in the SecTalks community brings something to contribute. Some
create CTF challenges, some organise teams, and others bring their friends to
fuel the conversation. Sponsoring enables you to foster those conversations.
Free to join and attend Thanks for our sponsors, SecTalks has been, and will
continue to be free of charge for members.

### Culture 
SecTalks is about giving and receiving, mentoring and learning. We
have created a culture of learning from others. In a SecTalks meetup, people
put their ego away and start to share their knowledge.  We have created an
intimate environment to give people the opportunity to speak out. Everyone with
a bit of passion in information security is welcome to attend. 

#### Our Values 
Teamwork, humour, having fun, sharing, learning and respect are
the key values within the SecTalks community. Since the start, SecTalks has
enforced our values during our meetings.  While we maintain good humour in all
our dealing, we keep SecTalks away from unacceptable behaviours (harassment,
stalking, deliberate intimidation, comments on race, sexual orientation, etc.)
and low value content (vendor pitch, politics, promotions, commercials, etc.).
This has enabled us to create a healthy environment for everyone to join and
enjoy.


### Reason to support SecTalks
* **Show you care and support a local not for profit community**: SecTalks was
started in Australia and is run by volunteers.  Each state has, on average, 
one meetup per month and 20-50 participants.  
* **Contribute to Australian information security community**: Without
a doubt, Australia has a lack of expertise in information security. SecTalks is
addressing this problem by creating a forum for people to get free guidance and
grow. The major benefit to sponsoring SecTalks is knowing that you are
contributing to, and encouraging participation in, the local security
community.  
* **A great place to find new talent**: SecTalks is attracting both
skilled security professionals and people with great potential that want to
take their career to the next step.  
* **Raise the awareness of your company profile to a targeted audience**: 
Increase your visibility and brand awareness
through the SecTalks website, meetup page, branded CTF prizes, etc.
