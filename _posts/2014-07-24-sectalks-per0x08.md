# 1 pwning meat: the impact of social engineering
Some of us exploit machines. When it's all over, the experience drops out of RAM and the machine goes about its business.
Some of us exploit people, and while people also have electrically erasable memory, the method is generally frowned upon.
What risks do social engineers take with their subjects? Can SE ever be considered white hat? Under what circumstances?
This SecTalks will be a discussion. The presenter is not an ethicist or a social engineer, so bring your ideas and opinions to share with everyone.
