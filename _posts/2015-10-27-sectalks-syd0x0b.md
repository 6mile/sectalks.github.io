#1 Capture the Flag 101 - Introduction

This is part one of a series of workshop-style presentations on CTF fundamentals. In this part we are going to learn what and whys of CTF, some basic CTF challenges and work  our way toward a solution. This is a good start for anyone interested or would like to get into CTF or start a career in technical security.

Note: This is a workshop session. Remember to bring your laptop and a working internet connection.

#2  60minutes CTF SYD0x0b

Like always, we are going to have a CTF challenge created by previous session winners.

Bring your gears+3g connection! (no laptop => no CTF!)
