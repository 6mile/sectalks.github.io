###Abstract

Introduction to binary analysis and exploitation. Zero knowledge is assumed with primers on the basics of C, virtual memory management, calling conventions and x86 assembly. Focus will be on providing an initial foundation of knowledge from which you can begin to experiment and learn further on your own. Bring your laptops. 

No fancy tools required (i.e. IDA Pro) we will only need gdb and objdump.
