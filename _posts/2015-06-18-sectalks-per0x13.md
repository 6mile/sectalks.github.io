PER0x13 

# 1 Why should you care about network forensics

Forget answering "can I be hacked" or even "have I been hacked" the answer to those questions are generally yes.  The important questions are "Am i being hacked right now ", "Who is hacking me right now" and "what are they taking".
this presentation will show you how to do network forensics using free* Linux VMs
*Free if you happen to have 30 thousand dollars worth of hardware sitting around.
