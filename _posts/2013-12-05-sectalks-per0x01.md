TRACER T AND ZERO COOL
There are many many novelty artifacts on the internet, the star wars telnet server, the star wars traceroute... I'm sure there are others. We developed our own, an IPv6, rDNS, traceroute based mechanism to disseminate movie scripts (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xbUpbTT6yg). We will provide details of how the system works, an example of the system in action and we will speculate wildly about potential future uses for this cutting edge information exchange mechanism.
