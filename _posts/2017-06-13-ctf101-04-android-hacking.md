###Abstract

This mobile applications workshop will help you understand how to approach pentesting of mobile applications.

1. Preparing a lab to test mobile applications
2. Tools for static checks on mobile applications
3. MiTM attack methods
4. Pentesting backend API

To fully take part and utilise the workshop, bring your own laptop with the following setup:

- Android SDK, ready emulator machines (or a rooted test device)

- few tools (adb, apktools, dex2jar, jdgui, any HTTP local proxy - e.g. Fiddler, Burp)

- few examples will work better or only on Linux, so you bring Windows on your own responsiblity

This is the first session of the two sessions workshop.
