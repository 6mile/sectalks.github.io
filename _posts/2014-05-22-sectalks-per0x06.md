#1 Script kiddie or an organized attack? Let me tell you about my insights into the world of darkness
In this presentation, I am going to uncover (for the first time) the system that I have been engineering on since 5.5 months ago and share with you the observation that I have had during my early experiment. The content of the presentation is exclusive to SecTalks members and subject to change until the time of the talk. So be ready for a fresh insight into the world of darkness!
