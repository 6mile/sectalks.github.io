#1 Robot Security: Where is it, Where is it going?
Robots are increasingly becoming part of our daily lives. As we begin to rely on them more and more it will become critical that they are secure and free from vulnerabilities. In my presentation I will look at where robot security is and where it might go. I will also take an in-depth look at current security and security failings of the Parrot AR.Drones, one of which will be hacked and rebooted mid-flight during the live demo.
