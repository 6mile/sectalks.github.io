4. Based on the number of participates, the group will be randomly divided into teams. PREPARE TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS
5. Participation in this CTF is under the condition that the winning team builds the next CTF. No Exceptions. If you want to play, know that you will need to do this. if you think you will have trouble with this and would like some guidance, Sagi is the person to contact
6. This is a learning excersise for everyone. The idea is to think about problems, make friends and have fun. Don't treat it like a competition (too much)
7. The winning team is the one who get closest to the solution or solve it within the 60 minutes. Hints will be droppped during the session to move things along if people get stuck.
8. Have fun.
9. If you are scared, don't be, the entire excersise is to encourage people to share knowlege and teach each other!
