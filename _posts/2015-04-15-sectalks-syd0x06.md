# 1 These aren't Androids you're looking for.

Android is being pushed inside almost everything these days, people say to
make things "smart". We tend to do more and more things on our phones,
something used only to make calls (and play snake) some time ago, now is
used to make bank transfers, store personal files and who knows what more.
These small devices tend to get more and more power, but with great power
comes great responsibility. The aim of this talk is to look on Android
through security lens and check what's there to see
