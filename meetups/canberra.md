## Want to Speak or Present?

Whether it is a [lightning talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk), an introduction to a tool or concept, or a hands-on workshop, SecTalks is great place to try presenting in front of a small, friendly crowd in a nice, informal setting. We encourage first-time speakers and anyone who would like to share their knowledge with the community to get in touch via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SecTalksCbr), [email](mailto:canberra@sectalks.org) or just talking to an organiser at a meetup.
